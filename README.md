This is a repository for a university project in which a vehicle is controlled via raspberry-pi to android communication.
Later on, autonomy shall be added.

The Raspberry uses a http Server (mongoose) to get commands from the Android App, that is connected to it via an Access Point.

We used Ian Rentons raspberrytank (https://github.com/ianrenton/raspberrytank) as a reference for our C code.
